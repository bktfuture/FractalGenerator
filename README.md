# Fractal Generator

Vanilla JavaScript project where I use DOM manipulations and a built-in canvas library to generate beautiful fractals.

Functionality: 
- You can randomize fractals.
- You can customize the number of branches, their spread, the fractal's colors and the canvas' color through the controls menu that you can hide.
- You can choose the type of fractal to draw (in process)
